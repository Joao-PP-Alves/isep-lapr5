// This optional code is used to register a service worker.

//a service worker is a script  that a browser runs in the background
//separate from  a web page, opening the door to features that don't
//need a web page or a user interaction.
//1.Service Workers require HTTPS. But to enable local testing, this restriction
// doesn't apply to localhost. This is for security reasons as a Service Worker 
//acts like a man in the middle between the web application and the server.
//2.With Create React App Service Worker is only enabled in the production environment,
//for example when running npm run build.
